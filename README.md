# Solar exposure calculator
finds the expected heat year round for a particular location. useful for HVAC or solar quotes.

built with OpenFrameworks and google maps api.



note
 - you will need to supply your own api key and signature for google maps. as of writing this there is a "free" option(you have to sign up and register a billing contact, however its free unless you exceed some limits - around $200 in uses per month last i checked)
 - limitations with openFrameworks state/app manangement resulted in me clapping a bunch of switch statements together to simulate class inheritance. forced this so the code may be more readable.
