# idle movement using bezier
built with OpenFrameworks.

note
 - this project was orgionally ment to be somethiing else entirely but openfarmeworks turned out to be the wrong tool for the job.
 - limitations with openFrameworks state/app manangement resulted in me clapping a bunch of switch statements together to simulate class inheritance. forced this so the code may be more readable.
